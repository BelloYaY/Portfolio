# Devansh Vadgama — Portfolio

A minimal, editorial portfolio exploring how complex systems can be made legible through thoughtful interface design.

This site represents my approach to computer engineering as a **design discipline** — focused on structure, clarity, and intent rather than surface-level features.

## About

I am a **Third Year Diploma student in Computer Engineering at Thakur Polytechnic**.

I treat my education as a rigorous design process:  
deconstructing how systems work, understanding their constraints, and rebuilding them into interfaces that are calm, readable, and intentional.

## Selected Work

The projects featured here are text-first and editorial by design.  
They are not demonstrations of tools, but explorations of **structure and decision-making**.

### Marginalia

Transforms dense policy documents into readable, structured, editorial-style formats.  
Focused on information hierarchy, reading rhythm, and cognitive clarity.

### After

Maps realistic paths after major academic and early-career milestones.  
Explores constraints, dependencies, and trade-offs without offering false optimism or advice.

### Envision

An environmental policy simulation where users navigate long-term trade-offs between ecology, economy, and public sentiment.  
Designed around cause-and-effect and consequence-driven interaction.

### Vasundara (Green Club)

A real-world website built for a student environmental committee.  
Focused on clarity, content structure, responsiveness, and stakeholder-oriented design.

## Design Philosophy

- Text over visuals
- Clarity over novelty
- Structure over decoration
- Motion as rhythm, not spectacle

The interface is intentionally restrained.  
Typography, spacing, and hierarchy do the heavy lifting.

---

## Status

This portfolio is considered **complete**.  
Future updates will prioritize clarity and intent over expansion.
